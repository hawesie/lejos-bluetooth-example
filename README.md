# lejos-bluetooth-example

An example of multiple NXTs talking to a single PC via Bluetooth. The code under `nxt` should be created as a leJOS NXT project and the code under `pc` should be created as a leJOS PC project. You must pair every NXT with the PC for the Bluetooth connection to work (hint: on Ubuntu I connected to each NXT using a known PIN, although for some reason when setting up each connection I had to select PIN Options twice before it remembered my choice). Once paired you can use `nxjbrowse -b` to get the name and address of the NXTs. This information should be put into `AdderConnection.java` in place of the details I've put there. Next, compile and upload `AdderClient.java` to each NXT then run it. Finally run `AdderConnection.java` and it should talk to all NXTs in parallel and double-check what they're sending back. Note that it appeears that the NXTComm Bluetooth class (or some other related part of the comms infrastructure) is not thread safe, so concurrent calls to it should be synchronised.
